This document is written as a guide to the internal code of this package.
It assumes basic knowledge of GAP.

Categories and families are defined in gap/categories_families.gd
    - The primary category is IsTwistedPolygonalComplex
    - The IsPolygonalComplex is a particular property

Constructors for polygonal complexes are constructed automatically
in gap/PolygonalComplexes/constructors.gi
